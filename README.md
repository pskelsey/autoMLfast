## Basic overview
A standalone desktop app that fully automates the machine learning workflow to generate the best predictive model for your data - all with the click of a few butons!
* Upload your own data or use our example data to get started.
* Your data is cleaned and made ready for use.
* A wide selection of ML algorithms will be tried on your data.
* These will be trained and tuned using *k*-fold cross-validation and ASHA optimization.
* Save your results.
* Use the best model to make predictions on new data.


### Installation and loading
The app is freely available to download and install on any dekstop PC. To download the app click the green "Code" button and select 'download ZIP' from the dropdown menu. The zipped executable file 'autoMLfast.exe' is a web-based installer (you will need an internet connection) that will install the app and download 'MATLAB Runtime' to your computer. MATLAB Runtime is a completely free execution engine that enables you to run MATLAB applications on computers that do not have a MATLAB license. So not only will you get this app, you will have access to thousands of others! To check for a new release of this app, click on the 'release' button near the top of the page.

NOTE: When the app is loading the splash screen may disappear for a brief interval before the app opens - there is no need to try and load it again, just give it a few seconds. The GUI is 'responsive' and can be scaled to any size, however this will change the layout of the controls. 

### Documentation
A full guide on how to use the app is provided in the [Documentation](https://github.com/pskelsey/autoMLfast/blob/master/documents/documentation.md)
